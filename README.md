# 02 - My Portfolio | Advanced CSS
### From Scratch &mdash; _create a web application!_
<br>

## Description

In this week's Challenge! I'll create a web application from scratch! It will be a portfolio page, which I will add to as the course progresses. 

To create this portfolio, I will employ some advanced CSS techniques, such as: 
* flexbox, 
* media queries, and 
* CSS variables.

**Note:** In liue of web applications to showcase at this point, I use placeholder images and names. 


## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager’s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```


## Mock-Up

The following animation shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
